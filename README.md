3.26Design a program using ordinary pipes in which one process sends astring message to a second process, and the second process reversesthe case of each character in the message and sends it back to the firstprocess. For example, if the first process sends the messageHi There,the second process will returnhI tHERE. This will require using twopipes, one for sending the original message from the first to the secondprocess and the other for sending the modified message from the secondto the first process. You can write this program using eitherUNIXorWindows pipes.
